# LoRA Metadata Viewer

Basic tool for viewing essential metadata for LoRA models. Shows the base model and tags (and frequencies) the model was trained with, which are essential if you've forgotten or can't find the original documentation.

Works with most, but not all, LoRAs in safetensors format.
